============== Adding a new completeness detection ======================

Add a new completeness detection class by implementing the interface
at ch.unibas.informatik.hs15.cs203.datarepository.api.CompletenessDetection
Which is kindly delivered to you under folder src/

Add your new implementation by putting it in data-repository-plugin.jar

You will also need to specify your class name in the properties file.
============== Examples =============================

By browsing ch.unibas.infomatik.hs15.cs203.datarepository.apps.server in the executable jar file <data-repository.jar>
you will find three implementations which may help you code a custom completeness detection.
